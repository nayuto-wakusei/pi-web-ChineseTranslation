"@jmfederico/pi-web": patch

Add an `ask_user` session tool that lets agents post structured question sets as one chat-native browser form. The form uses the transcript's single scroll area, keeps its header visible, and always gives every question a Custom free-text answer with mobile-safe text sizing. Agents end their run while the form waits; users can submit full or partial answers, unanswered questions are reported explicitly, sending an ordinary chat message voids the open form, pending forms survive browser and web/API reconnects, and closed forms remain readable in the transcript. Disable the tool from **Settings → Session daemon**, with `askUser: false`, or with `PI_WEB_ASK_USER=false`.
