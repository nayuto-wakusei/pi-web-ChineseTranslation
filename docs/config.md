# PI WEB configuration reference

PI WEB configuration covers the machine-local and project-local settings you usually need: the web/API bind address, trusted development-host settings, UI preferences, plugin enablement, file-explorer path access, manual upload defaults, upload limits, Pi-compatible agent profiles and companion CLIs, and session-daemon tools.

This file is the markdown reference for agents and package consumers. The website page is <https://pi-web.dev/config>.

## Config files

PI WEB uses two config files:

- **Global PI WEB config:** `$PI_WEB_CONFIG`, or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pi-web/config.json`, or `~/.config/pi-web/config.json`.
- **Project-local PI WEB config:** `<project>/.pi-web/config.json` for commit-able project settings.

Normal-mode provider credentials and custom models are stored separately for each registered project under the managed data directory (`$PI_WEB_DATA_DIR`, or `~/.pi-web`):

- Each project has its own managed `auth.json` and `models.json`.
- All worktrees belonging to the same project share those two files.
- On first use, PI WEB copies the existing global Pi files from the effective Pi agent directory (by default `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` and `~/.pi/agent/models.json`) into the project store. Later changes are independent; the global files are not a fallback.
- Normal-mode auth requests and new session/list requests must resolve to a registered project. Existing active sessions keep the project registry they were opened with, even if the project is later closed. Management-embed mode keeps its separate managed credential store.

Each PI WEB machine has its own config. When using Fleet/machine federation, Settings uses the selected machine for config that affects work running there: session daemon tools, PI WEB plugin enablement, external path access, and upload defaults. Gateway/browser-only settings stay local to the gateway: keyboard shortcuts, remote machine registry/tokens, and gateway host/port/allowed-hosts. Remote servers that do not advertise selected-machine settings support report those settings as unavailable instead of silently falling back to the gateway.

Pi package settings are separate from PI WEB config. They live in Pi's package-manager settings on the target machine and are managed by Pi (`pi install`, `pi remove`, `pi update`) or **Settings → Pi packages**. In a federated setup, **Settings → Pi packages** targets the currently selected machine. The PI WEB `plugins` config key only enables or disables discovered PI WEB browser plugins on the machine whose config you are editing; it does not install, remove, or update Pi packages.

If you installed services with a custom config path, rerun `pi-web install --config /path/to/config.json` after changing that path or after upgrading from a version that only applied the custom path to the web service. This regenerates service files so the web/API and session daemon use the same `PI_WEB_CONFIG`.

## Reverse-proxy deployment paths

The deployment path is not a PI WEB config-file key or environment setting. The published client is portable: one build works at `/` and at canonical trailing-slash prefixes such as `/ai/` or `/test/ai/`.

For a nested deployment, redirect the slashless prefix to the trailing-slash URL, strip the prefix before forwarding to PI WEB, and proxy authenticated HTTP and WebSocket traffic through the same location. Relative browser and PWA URLs then stay within that prefix. See the [reverse proxy installation guide](https://pi-web.dev/install#reverse-proxy-prefix) for a complete Nginx example.

## Precedence and reloads

Machine-global runtime values are resolved as:

```text
defaults → global config file → environment overrides
```

Supported project-local settings are then applied for that project's workspaces. For upload defaults, `<project>/.pi-web/config.json` overrides the global value.

Environment overrides include `PI_WEB_HOST`, `PI_WEB_PORT` / `PORT`, `PI_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `PI_WEB_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`, `PI_WEB_AGENT_COMMAND`, `PI_WEB_AGENT_DIR`, `PI_WEB_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`, `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` / `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`, `PI_WEB_ENVIRONMENT_FACTS`, `PI_WEB_SPAWN_SESSIONS`, `PI_WEB_SUBSESSIONS`, and `PI_WEB_ASK_USER`.

Process restarts depend on the key:

- `host` / `port`: restart the gateway web/API service or process.
- `maxUploadBytes`: restart both the web/API process and the session daemon on that machine.
- `agent.command` / `agent.dir` / `spawnSessions` / `subsessions` / `askUser` / `extensionDialogsTimeoutMs`: restart the session daemon on that machine.
- `workbenchIntegration`: restart both the web/API process and session daemon; both processes must use the same endpoints and limits.
- `pathAccess`: applies on the next request; existing file views may need a browser refresh.
- `uploads.defaultFolder`: applies to newly opened Files upload dialogs and new direct drag/drop batches after config/workspace refresh.
- `plugins`: reload the browser tab after changing PI WEB plugin enablement.
- Pi package install/remove/update: not a PI WEB config key; after a mutation, type `/reload` in each idle PI WEB session on the target machine to refresh ordinary Pi resources such as extensions, skills, prompt templates, themes, and context/system prompt files. Reload the browser page separately for PI WEB browser plugin changes. If a global Pi extension adds or removes a provider, or changes a provider's connection settings, manually restart `pi-web-sessiond.service`; `/reload` cannot change the startup provider baseline. A known provider refreshing only its own model list is applied without a restart. See [Pi extension provider baseline](#pi-extension-provider-baseline).
- `shortcuts`: saved settings apply in the browser after config refresh/save.

## Project-local config

Project-local config lives at `<project>/.pi-web/config.json`. Use it for settings that should follow a repository.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "pathAccess": {
    "allowedPaths": ["~/SDKs", "/opt/reference"]
  },
  "uploads": {
    "defaultFolder": "manual/uploads"
  }
}
```

Project-local `pathAccess.allowedPaths` entries are merged after the global list and deduplicated. Paths must still be host-absolute or `~`-prefixed; relative roots are not supported.

Project-local `uploads.defaultFolder` overrides the global upload destination for workspaces in that project. Current PI WEB servers include this workspace-effective value on the existing workspace responses used locally and through machine federation. Older remote servers may omit the optional field; the browser falls back to the global/default upload folder.

Plugins may own separate project files, such as `.pi-web/tasks.json` for the built-in Workspace Tasks plugin.

## Configuration matrix

Rows with JSON key `—` are runtime-only environment variables, not config-file keys. `Global` means machine-global. In Settings, selected-machine-safe global keys (`pathAccess`, `uploads`, `maxUploadBytes`, `agent`, `spawnSessions`, `subsessions`, `askUser`, and `plugins`) are edited for the selected machine; gateway host/port/allowed-hosts, keyboard shortcuts, and machine registry/tokens stay local.

## Key details

### Ordinary-mode tool audit

PI WEB stores metadata-only ordinary-mode tool calls in `$PI_WEB_DATA_DIR/audit/normal-tool-calls.sqlite` while keeping the existing Pino/service logs. Management-embed calls are not written to this database. Each row contains the session and workspace, tool and call identifiers, start/end timestamps, duration, and `started`, `completed`, `failed`, or `interrupted` status. Arguments, results, prompts, model replies, and credentials are never stored.

`auditLog.normalMode.enabled` defaults to `true`. `retentionDays` defaults to `90`, and `maxRows` defaults to `500000`. The session daemon prunes at startup and every 24 hours. Database failures are reported through the existing logger and do not stop tool execution.

Use the CLI to inspect and maintain the database:

```bash
pi-web audit list --since 24h
pi-web audit list --status failed --since 7d
pi-web audit stats --since 30d
pi-web audit export --since 30d --format csv --output audit.csv
pi-web audit prune --before 2026-05-01
pi-web audit vacuum
```

The database uses WAL mode so these read operations can run while sessiond is active. A graceful sessiond shutdown and the next startup mark unfinished calls as `interrupted`; changing audit configuration requires restarting sessiond.

### Management-mode Elasticsearch audit

Management-embed audit records can be sent to Elasticsearch while the existing Pino/service logs remain enabled. Set `auditLog.managementMode.enabled` to `true` and provide `baseUrl`, or set `PI_WEB_AUDIT_ES_URL`. Authentication is read only from the session daemon environment: `PI_WEB_AUDIT_ES_API_KEY` takes precedence, while basic authentication requires both `PI_WEB_AUDIT_ES_USERNAME` and `PI_WEB_AUDIT_ES_PASSWORD`. Credentials must not be included in `baseUrl`.

Records are written to Shanghai-calendar ISO-week indices such as `pi-web-management-audit-2026-w32`. `indexPrefix` defaults to `pi-web-management-audit`; `retentionDays` defaults to `365`. Sessiond installs a strict index template, batches writes through the Elasticsearch Bulk API, and runs retention at startup and daily. The first successful maintenance in each Shanghai calendar month deletes documents whose `@timestamp` is older than the retention cutoff.

Each document identifies `user.id`, `user.root_user_id`, the authorized project owning the actual workspace, the Pi session, and, when applicable, the Workbench Agent Session. Tool calls include tool/call identifiers and status. Capability and Skill events add fixed resource versions, authorization revision, run/trace identifiers, status, duration, and retry metadata. Prompts, tool arguments, tool results, model replies, access tokens, API keys, cookies, and capability tickets are excluded.

Elasticsearch failures are reported through Pino and do not stop management sessions. Failed batches remain in a bounded in-memory retry queue and are flushed during graceful sessiond shutdown; a process crash can lose records that have not yet reached Elasticsearch. Use Elasticsearch or Kibana index permissions to limit user-level audit access.

### Workbench and MCP integration

`workbenchIntegration` enables the controlled management-embed adapter for the network model workbench. These resource, tool, and Skill restrictions apply only to management-embed sessions; normal-mode sessions keep PI WEB's existing behavior. `baseUrl` is the server-reachable workbench backend origin, while `mcpUrl` is the MCP Streamable HTTP endpoint. Both are required; the environment variables override the corresponding JSON URLs.

The adapter exchanges the one-time management token for a private Agent Session, loads only the resulting fixed resource snapshot, and exposes `icnoc_search_capabilities` and `icnoc_call_capability` alongside the managed file tools and sandboxed `python` tool. When their global feature switches are enabled, management sessions also receive `spawn_session`, the tracked-subsessions tool set headed by `spawn_subsession`, and `ask_user`; spawned sessions inherit the same management context. Python runs without network access in an isolated Bubblewrap environment that binds only the managed workspace. Generic MCP, HTTP, web search, shell, and terminal tools remain denied in management mode. Skill bundles are downloaded only from the MCP origin, checked against the authorized fixed version and manifest, and stored under the managed project's `.pi/skills/` directory. Tokens and tickets remain server-side.

The session daemon emits metadata-only tool execution audit entries for both normal and management sessions. These entries include the mode, session, workspace, tool name, call id, and execution status; tool arguments and results are deliberately excluded. Workbench capability calls additionally emit their business and MCP trace identifiers.

Set the same effective config and environment on the web/API and session daemon services. Changing any integration endpoint or limit requires restarting both services.

### Managed data directory

`PI_WEB_DATA_DIR` sets the root for PI WEB-managed runtime state and defaults to `~/.pi-web`. Unless a more specific path override is configured, PI WEB stores its project and machine registries, locally discovered plugins, default session-daemon socket, and session archives beneath this root.

Each data directory is independent: after pointing PI WEB at a new root, it starts there with empty registries and no session archives. To carry session archives over, stop PI WEB, then copy `archived-sessions.json` and the `archived-sessions/` directory from the old data directory into the new one before starting it again.

This setting does not change the PI WEB config file selected by `PI_WEB_CONFIG` or Pi-owned state such as the active session files selected by `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`.

### External path access

`pathAccess.allowedPaths` grants PI WEB's file explorer and absolute `@` path completions access to specific filesystem roots outside the current workspace.

By default, workspace-relative file reads stay inside the workspace and absolute paths are denied. Add only roots you trust PI WEB to list and read through the browser UI.

Accepted root forms:

- Unix absolute paths: `/opt/reference`
- Home-relative paths: `~/SDKs`
- Windows absolute paths on Windows hosts: `C:\Users\dev\SDKs`

When an absolute request is served, PI WEB expands `~`, canonicalizes the configured roots with `realpath`, requires roots to be existing directories, and rejects symlink escapes outside the allowed roots.

In **Settings → General**, external filesystem roots are saved on the selected machine. Gateway host, port, and allowed-hosts fields stay on the gateway config.

This is not a sandbox for the underlying Pi Coding Agent or your OS user. It only controls PI WEB UI/API file exposure outside a workspace.

### Manual upload defaults

The Files panel can upload one or more files in two ways:

- Drop files onto the Files panel to upload immediately to the workspace-effective default folder.
- Use the toolbar **Upload** button to open the review dialog, edit the destination, and opt into upload options.

`uploads.defaultFolder` sets the workspace-effective default destination. The built-in default is `.pi-web/uploads`; a global config value applies to every project unless `<project>/.pi-web/config.json` sets a project-local override.

```json
{
  "uploads": {
    "defaultFolder": "manual/uploads"
  }
}
```

The value must be a non-empty workspace-relative folder. PI WEB normalizes repeated separators and backslashes to `/`, and rejects absolute paths or `..` traversal. In the upload dialog only, clearing the destination field uploads that batch to the workspace root.

Manual uploads use the workspace file-write path: paths stay workspace-relative, parent folder creation is enabled by default, and overwrite is disabled by default. Direct drag/drop always keeps `overwrite` off; the review dialog lets you explicitly enable overwrite when needed. Browser-owned XHR progress is shown per batch/file, conflicts and errors stay visible in the upload progress UI, and the final file-write response is the source of truth.

For machine federation, Settings saves the global upload default on the selected machine. Current remote PI WEB servers also return `workspace.effectiveConfig.uploads.defaultFolder` on the existing workspace-list response. Older remote servers can omit that optional field without breaking clients; the Files panel falls back to the global/default upload folder.

The per-request size limit is still controlled by `maxUploadBytes` / `PI_WEB_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` on the machine serving the upload.

### Pi-compatible agent profile and companion CLI

PI WEB embeds Pi Coding Agent `0.84.x` or newer compatible runtime packages. The session daemon owns one resolved Pi state directory and refuses to start a second daemon against the same `PI_WEB_DATA_DIR`; use distinct data and endpoint variables for another instance.

`agent.command` selects the Pi-compatible companion CLI used by `pi-web doctor` and, when it can be generated safely, package-managed update commands. It defaults to `pi`. This setting does **not** replace the embedded runtime: every session continues to use PI WEB's bundled Pi SDK.

`agent.dir` selects the Pi-compatible state profile used for auth providers, models, settings, sessions, Pi packages, and Pi-package-backed PI WEB plugin discovery. It defaults to `~/.pi/agent` only for a canonical Pi companion command. The directory must use the data layout supported by the bundled Pi SDK; PI WEB does not load or convert incompatible fork formats, migrate profile data, or repartition PI WEB-managed archives when the profile changes.

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "command": "pi-lab",
    "dir": "/opt/pi-profiles/lab"
  }
}
```

An alternate command always requires an explicit state directory. The command must be a safe bare executable name such as `pi-lab` or a host-absolute executable path such as `/opt/pi/bin/pi`; relative paths, shell expressions, and launcher strings are rejected. The state directory must be host-absolute or start with `~`. In a federated save, the gateway transports Unix and Windows absolute paths without reinterpreting them, and the target machine validates and returns the persisted profile.

Environment variables take precedence over the config file. For the state directory, precedence is `PI_WEB_AGENT_DIR` > `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` > `agent.dir` > the Pi default. For session storage, `PI_WEB_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` remains first for compatibility, followed by `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`. The resolved directory is exported as `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` to embedded Pi processes. `PI_WEB_ENVIRONMENT_FACTS=false` disables the ordinary-session nesting guidance block.

The session daemon resolves the persisted desired values plus its environment once at startup. That secret-free active profile stays fixed for the daemon lifetime. **Settings → Session daemon** saves command and directory together as desired configuration and shows whether the profile is active, needs a restart, or cannot be compared. Until the daemon restarts, sessions, Pi package operations, Pi-package-backed PI WEB plugin discovery, status/install detection, and update planning continue to use the daemon-owned active profile; a web/API restart recovers that same active profile instead of applying the newly saved values.

If the session daemon cannot report a valid active profile, profile-dependent Pi package and PI WEB plugin operations report unavailable instead of falling back to independently resolved config. A package-managed update command is shown only when PI WEB can preserve the active profile with a recognized, safe Pi companion CLI; otherwise the command is omitted. Remote profile editing likewise requires advertised support, and the gateway rejects a remote save if the target does not return the requested profile. Restart the session daemon on the selected machine to establish the next active profile.

### Pi extension provider baseline

This policy applies to **Pi runtime extensions**, not PI WEB browser plugins. Pi extensions are runtime modules loaded by the session daemon and can call `pi.registerProvider(...)`; PI WEB plugins are browser-side UI modules and never run in the session daemon.

PI WEB shares one model runtime across all sessions. When the session daemon starts, before any project resources load, it initializes global Pi extensions from the active agent profile (`agent.dir`), including extensions supplied by globally configured Pi packages. Provider registrations made by synchronous or awaited asynchronous extension factories during this bootstrap join the shared baseline. PI WEB captures both config-form registrations (`pi.registerProvider("id", config)`) and native-provider registrations (`pi.registerProvider(provider)`), alongside Pi built-ins, environment credentials, and providers from the active agent directory's `models.json`.

After startup capture, a provider's connection settings are fixed for the daemon lifetime. Later attempts to add a provider, replace an existing provider's configuration, register a native provider, or unregister a provider are no-ops, regardless of source or provider ID. This includes project extensions attempting to add or replace a provider, lifecycle callbacks such as `session_start`, and `/reload`. Non-provider Pi extension features continue to load and reload normally.

#### Model list refresh for a known provider

One narrow update is applied after startup: a provider captured in the baseline may refresh **its own model list**. Extensions that fetch an updated catalog typically re-send their complete provider configuration, so PI WEB compares the incoming registration against the recorded baseline and applies it only when both hold:

- the provider ID is already in the startup baseline, and
- every field except the model list is unchanged — `name`, `baseUrl`, `apiKey`, `api`, `streamSimple`, `headers`, `authHeader`, `oauth`, and `refreshModels`.

Anything else stays a no-op, including a provider that was not in the baseline and a known provider whose credentials, base URL, or API surface differ from startup. Function-valued fields cannot be compared by value, so a registration that supplies a new `streamSimple`, `refreshModels`, or `oauth` implementation is treated as a change and ignored.

An applied refresh becomes the new comparison point, so a provider can refresh repeatedly. Re-sending an unchanged model list is a replay rather than an update and is ignored. Refreshed models are visible to sessions immediately; no restart and no network request is involved, because the extension has already produced the catalog.

Model lists are shared daemon-wide state. If extensions in two workspaces register different model lists for the same provider ID, the last registration wins. A model entry may also carry its own `baseUrl` and `headers`, which take precedence over the provider-level values for that model, so an accepted refresh can change where requests for those models are sent. Both are accepted trade-offs: a catalog is treated as a property of the provider rather than of the project, and Pi extensions are trusted daemon code.

#### Provider decisions in the daemon log

Ignored mutations are written to the session-daemon log once per operation and provider ID, so a replaying extension cannot flood the log. Applied model list refreshes are logged every time, with the resulting model count, because each one changes shared runtime state. Neither entry contains provider configuration or credentials, and PI WEB does not show a session warning or notification.

This prevents accidental provider, configuration, or credential contamination between projects; it is not a security boundary because Pi extensions remain trusted daemon code.

Configure providers before the daemon starts: use the active agent directory's `models.json`, or install the Pi extension globally in that agent profile. Project Pi extensions and project-level `models.json` files cannot add providers to PI WEB's shared baseline. After updating PI WEB—or after installing, removing, or updating a global Pi extension that registers providers—manually restart `pi-web-sessiond.service` (`systemctl --user restart pi-web-sessiond`). Restarting only the web/API service and running `/reload` do not rebuild the baseline.

### Background model catalog refresh

PI WEB shares one model runtime across all sessions, and provider model catalogs are refreshed over the network only on the session daemon's own background schedule. Requests never start a catalog fetch of their own, so a slow or unreachable provider cannot stall opening the model selector, starting a session, or the auth dialogs on its own account.

A refresh that is *already* in flight can still briefly delay starting or opening a session, because the shared runtime is read while that refresh is running. PI WEB says so while you wait: the session's activity line names the startup step it is on and adds `provider model lists are refreshing` when a background refresh is running at the same time. That note reports what is happening concurrently, not a proven cause.

The session daemon runs the refresh:

- **15 seconds after the daemon starts**, then **hourly**. Pi treats stored catalogs as fresh for four hours, so most hourly ticks make no network request at all; the shorter tick only makes sure a due refresh is not delayed to the next tick.
- **Immediately after a provider login or logout**, bypassing that freshness window, because the cached catalog is known to be wrong.

Each run is bounded: it is aborted after **60 seconds**, and a run that times out or cannot reach a provider earns **one retry after five minutes**; a provider that answers with an error status is retried on the next scheduled refresh instead. Failures never clear the stored catalogs — the last successfully fetched models stay in use and the daemon log records what failed. A refresh in flight is also aborted when the daemon shuts down.

Models fetched by a background refresh appear the next time a client asks for the model list, so a model selector left open across a refresh may need to be reopened.

To turn the background refresh off entirely, set `PI_WEB_OFFLINE` or `PI_OFFLINE` in the session daemon's environment and restart it. In offline mode PI WEB performs no provider catalog network requests, including after logins, and sessions use the catalogs already stored in the agent profile. The `PI_WEB_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK` and `PI_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK` keys do **not** affect this refresh; they only suppress PI WEB release checks.

### Session daemon tools

`spawnSessions` controls whether agents receive the `spawn_session` tool. It defaults to `true`; set it to `false` if you do not want an agent to start independent PI WEB sessions.

`subsessions` is beta and controls whether agents receive the tracked-subsession tools: `spawn_subsession`, `list_subsessions`, `check_subsession`, `read_subsession`, and `yield_to_subsessions`. It defaults to `false` and also requires `spawnSessions` to be enabled.

Tracked subsessions are join-oriented. Calling `spawn_subsession` returns immediately, so the parent can continue independent work while the child runs. Work whose result the parent does not need to join belongs in the fire-and-forget `spawn_session` tool instead.

At a join point, after finishing its independent work, the parent calls `yield_to_subsessions` alone as the final action in its tool batch. Pi ends a tool batch early only when every result in that batch is terminating. If any tracked child is still working, the action ends the current agent run so the parent becomes idle. If none are working, it does not end the run and clearly reports that there is nothing to wait for.

A completion notice wakes an idle parent or queues behind in-flight work. Each notice lists any other tracked children still working, so the parent can continue work or call `yield_to_subsessions` again at the next join point. Further notices arrive automatically; do not poll. The notice includes the child's final output when it fits. If that output is too long, PI WEB omits it entirely instead of adding a truncated duplicate to the parent's context and directs the parent to retrieve it with `check_subsession`.

`list_subsessions`, `check_subsession`, and `read_subsession` never yield or change control flow. They are for deliberate inspection or recovery, not completion polling. While a child works, agent-facing `check_subsession` and `read_subsession` withhold partial output and direct the parent to continue independent work or yield at the join point. Output becomes available when the child stops. Included output and transcripts follow a labeled marker and come last, after PI WEB guidance.

`spawn_session` 和 `spawn_subsession` 都接受可选的 `model` 参数，其值必须是精确的 `provider/model-id`，例如 `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`。设置后，新会话会使用该模型，而不是继承发起会话的模型。匹配是严格的：未知值或格式错误的值会被拒绝并返回错误。用户可以在提示词中通过 `#provider/model-id` 引用指定模型（见[提示词补全](#prompt-completions)），代理会将该引用作为此参数传递。新会话还会继承发起会话当前的思考级别，并根据所选模型的能力自动限制该级别。

In **Settings → Session daemon**, these keys are saved on the selected machine. Restart the session daemon on that machine after changing them.

#### `askUser` and `ask_user`

`askUser` controls whether agents receive the core `ask_user` tool. It defaults to `true`; set it to `false`, or set `PI_WEB_ASK_USER=false`, to remove the tool. The environment override accepts `0|1|true|false` and takes precedence over the config file.

Use **Settings → Session daemon → Allow agents to ask questions** to change `askUser` on the selected machine. An environment override makes the toggle read-only.

The tool accepts one set of 1–20 questions. Each question has a unique `id`, its `question` text, optional supporting `detail`, up to 12 options with stable values and user-facing labels, and an optional `multiple` flag. The browser always adds a **Custom** free-text answer, including when the model supplies no options. No question is required: the user may leave any of them unanswered.

Calling `ask_user` posts the whole set as one browser form and ends the current agent run instead of waiting for the user. The open form is owned by the session daemon, so it survives a browser disconnect, browser reload, or web/API restart while that daemon keeps running. When the user submits, the answers arrive as a follow-up that wakes the session; each question is reported with its selected option values or free text, or explicitly as unanswered.

PI WEB confirms a partial submission before sending it and names the unanswered questions. Only one ask can be open per session: a later `ask_user` call supersedes the earlier one, reports that fact and its unanswered questions to the model, and turns the earlier card into a read-only transcript record. Submitted and cancelled asks likewise remain readable in the transcript.

Sending an ordinary chat message while a form is open voids the form: the card closes as cancelled and the model is told its questions went unanswered as part of the turn the message itself starts.

Restart the session daemon after changing `askUser` or after upgrading PI WEB to a version that introduces this tool. For the systemd user service, run `systemctl --user restart pi-web-sessiond`.

### 扩展对话框

Pi 扩展可以通过 `ctx.ui.confirm()`、`ctx.ui.select()` 和 `ctx.ui.input()` 向用户提问，包括从 `session_start` 钩子以及运行中的 `tool_call` 钩子发起。PI WEB 会在会话记录中以内联方式显示这些对话框，并通过独立的会话守护进程通道返回回答，不经过提示词队列，因此等待回答的 `tool_call` 钩子不会阻塞运行。对话框支持始终启用，没有单独的启用开关。行为细节和扩展开发说明见 [PI WEB 中的 Pi 扩展对话框](https://pi-web.dev/plugins#pi-extension-dialogs)。

`extensionDialogsTimeoutMs` 是无人处理对话框时的安全超时：会话守护进程等待回答的最长时间，超时后将以对应类型的取消值结束对话框（确认框为 `false`，选择框和输入框为 `undefined`）。默认值为 `300000`（5 分钟）；设为 `0` 时永久等待。扩展自身设置的 `timeout` 仍然生效，最终期限取两者中较早的时间。

该配置项直接在全局配置文件中编辑。修改后需要重启会话守护进程；使用 systemd 用户服务时运行 `systemctl --user restart pi-web-sessiond`。

### Plugin config

The `plugins` key is only for PI WEB browser plugin enablement/settings on the machine whose config you are editing. It does not install, remove, or update Pi packages; use **Settings → Pi packages** or Pi's package manager for package operations. In a federated setup, **Settings → PI WEB plugins** and **Settings → Pi packages** both target the currently selected machine, and each panel labels where changes will be saved or run.

Plugins are enabled by default. Set `plugins.<id>.enabled` to `false` to remove a plugin from that machine's `/pi-web-plugins/manifest.json` before the browser imports it. Settings lists discovered plugins from the selected machine, including disabled entries exposed by that machine.

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "workspace-tasks": { "enabled": true, "settings": {} },
    "updates": { "enabled": false }
  }
}
```

Reload the browser tab after changing plugin enablement. Already-loaded plugin JavaScript is not unloaded from the current page.

### Shortcut config

Shortcut values are keyed by action id. Values are shortcut strings such as `mod+k` or `mod+g p`; `null` disables that action's shortcut.

```json
{
  "shortcuts": {
    "core:view.chat": "mod+1",
    "core:session.stop": null
  }
}
```

Prefer Settings → Keyboard for editing shortcuts interactively.

## 提示词补全

聊天输入框会在键入以下三个触发字符时打开补全菜单：

- 在草稿开头键入 `/` 可补全会话命令。
- `@` 用于补全文件路径：`@` 显示已跟踪文件，`@ `（先键入 `@`，再键入空格）或 `!@` 显示所有文件。选中后会把 `@path` 引用插入草稿；路径包含空格时会自动加引号。
- `#` 用于补全当前会话可用的模型；输入时不区分大小写地筛选，最多显示 12 项。选中后会把 `#provider/model-id` 引用插入草稿，提示代理应使用该模型执行请求，例如作为 `spawn_session` 的 `model` 参数。

## Optional completion tools

File and path `@` completions work without extra tools. If `fzf` is available on the PI WEB server's `PATH`, PI WEB uses it to improve completion filtering/ranking; otherwise it falls back to built-in ranking.
